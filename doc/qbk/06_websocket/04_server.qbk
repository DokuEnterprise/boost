[section Handshaking (Servers)]

A
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream `stream`]
automatically handles receiving and processing the HTTP response to the
handshake request. The call to handshake is successful if a HTTP response
is received with the
[@https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-4.2.2 ['101 Switching Protocols]]
status code. On failure, an error is returned or an exception is thrown.
Depending on the keep alive setting, the connection may remain open for
a subsequent handshake attempt.
A typical HTTP Upgrade response created and sent by the implementation
upon receiving an upgrade request handshake will look like this:

[table WebSocket Upgrade HTTP Response
[[Serialized Octets][Description]]
[[
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: upgrade
    Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
    Server: Boost.Beast/216
    ```
][
    The
    [@https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-11.3.3 ['Sec-WebSocket-Accept]]
    field value is generated from the request in a fashion specified by
    the WebSocket protocol.
]]]

The
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream `stream`]
member functions
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream.accept `accept`] and
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream.async_accept `async_accept`]
are used to read the WebSocket HTTP Upgrade request handshake from a stream
already connected to an incoming peer, and then send the WebSocket HTTP
Upgrade response, as shown:

[code_websocket_3_server_1]



[heading Passing HTTP Requests]

When implementing an HTTP server that also supports WebSocket, the
server usually reads the HTTP request from the client. To detect when
the incoming HTTP request is a WebSocket Upgrade request, the function
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__is_upgrade `is_upgrade`] may be used.

Once the caller determines that the HTTP request is a WebSocket Upgrade,
additional overloads of
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream.accept `accept`] and
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream.async_accept `async_accept`]
are provided which receive the entire HTTP request header as an object
to perform the handshake. By reading the request manually, the program
can handle normal HTTP requests as well as upgrades. The program may
also enforce policies based on the HTTP fields, such as Basic
Authentication. In this example, the request is first read in
using the HTTP algorithms, and then passed to a newly constructed
stream:

[code_websocket_3_server_1b]



[heading Buffered Handshakes]

Sometimes a server implementation wishes to read octets on the stream
in order to route the incoming request. For example, a server may read
the first 6 octets after accepting an incoming connection to determine
if a TLS protocol is being negotiated, and choose a suitable implementation
at run-time. In the case where the server wishes to accept the incoming
request as an HTTP WebSocket Upgrade request, additional overloads of
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream.accept `accept`] and
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__websocket__stream.async_accept `async_accept`]
are provided which receive the additional buffered octets and consume
them as part of the handshake.

In this example, the server reads the initial HTTP message into the
specified dynamic buffer as an octet sequence in the buffer's output
area, and later uses those octets to attempt an HTTP WebSocket Upgrade:

[code_websocket_3_server_2]

The implementation uses a fixed-size storage area to hold buffers passed
using these functions. If an application is reaching the limit of the
internal buffer size, then the websocket stream may be instantiated with
the next layer type of
[link beast.ref.boost__beast__buffered_read_stream `buffered_read_stream`]
to wrap the underlying stream. The buffered handshake data may be first
placed into the buffered read stream, which uses a dynamically sized
buffer.
